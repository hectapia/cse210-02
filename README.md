# Hilo
Are you willing to make predictions? Play Hilo and have fun.
The rules are simple, we have thirteen hidden cards numbered from 1 through 13. Hilo opens the game with
the worth of one card and gives you a score of 300 points in the beginning. Now is your turn, you must predict the worth
of the next card. If your prediction is correct then you will win 100 points. If your prediction 
is incorrect then you will lose 75 points. You can do predictions as many as you want, it is
your choice. 

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```

```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.
